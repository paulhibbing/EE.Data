## Submission

This is the initial submission of a data-only package that houses model objects
that are needed for predicting energy expenditure in research studies.

* A companion package will be submitted which uses these modeling objects for prediction.
* The size of the model objects has been reduced as much as possible.
* xz compression has been used in conjunction with 'LazyDataCompression: xz' in DESCRIPTION.
* The majority of package size is taken up by a random forest object, while others are smaller.
